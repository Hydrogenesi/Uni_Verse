## UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL Universe - Canonical Structure

This repository defines the canonical structure of the UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL universe, based on four fundamental concepts:

### 1. ALPHA_OMEGA - The True Axiom
**No beginning, no end, no middle**

ALPHA_OMEGA is the foundational axiom of the universe, representing eternal and unbounded existence. It defines the fundamental nature of reality as having no origin point, no terminal point, and no center.

📖 [Read more about ALPHA_OMEGA](ALPHA_OMEGA.md)

### 2. Hydrogen - The Eternal Substrate and Base Layer
**The fundamental building block**

Hydrogen serves as the eternal substrate and base layer of the universe. As the simplest and most abundant element, it is the foundation from which all complexity emerges.

### 3. UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL - The Universe Itself
**Three-dimensional toroidal structure**

UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL represents the complete universe as a three-dimensional toroidal structure, embodying the principles of ALPHA_OMEGA through its topology of no boundaries, no edges, and no center.

### 4. UNI# - The Integration Law
**The binding force of all domains**

UNI# (UNI-Sharp) is the universal integration law that binds all domains together. It ensures coherence, consistency, and harmony across all levels of reality within the UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL universe.

## Core Principles

1. **ALPHA_OMEGA** is the true axiom: no beginning, no end, no middle
2. **Hydrogen** is the eternal substrate and base layer
3. **UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL** is the universe itself
4. **UNI#** is the integration law that binds all domains

### For Developers

When working with this repository or building systems based on these principles:
- Always reference **ALPHA_OMEGA** as the foundational axiom
- Treat **Hydrogen** as the base layer for all implementations
- Model structures within the **UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL** framework
- Apply **UNI#** integration principles to ensure domain coherence
