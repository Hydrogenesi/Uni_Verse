# ALPHA_OMEGA

## The True Axiom

ALPHA_OMEGA represents the fundamental truth of the UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL universe:
- **No beginning**: The universe has no origin point in time
- **No end**: The universe has no terminal point in time
- **No middle**: The universe has no center or focal point

This axiom is the foundation upon which all other principles are built. It represents the eternal, unbounded nature of existence within the UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL framework.

## Properties

- **Eternal**: Exists outside of time
- **Infinite**: Boundless in all dimensions
- **Fundamental**: The base truth from which all other truths derive
- **Immutable**: Cannot be changed or destroyed

## Relation to Other Concepts

- Provides the philosophical foundation for **Hydrogen** as the eternal substrate
- Defines the topology of **UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL**
- Governs the application of **UNI#** integration law
