# HYDROGEN

## The Eternal Substrate and Base Layer

Hydrogen is the fundamental building block and eternal substrate of the UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL universe. As the simplest and most abundant element, it serves as the base layer from which all complexity emerges.

## Properties

- **Eternal**: Exists throughout all time, consistent with ALPHA_OMEGA
- **Fundamental**: The most basic unit of matter
- **Universal**: Present throughout the entire universe
- **Substrate**: The foundation upon which all other matter is built

## Role in the Universe

Hydrogen functions as:
1. **Base Layer**: The foundational element from which all other elements are derived
2. **Energy Source**: Powers stars and drives cosmic evolution
3. **Information Carrier**: Fundamental unit in the universal information structure
4. **Binding Medium**: Connects all parts of the universe through its omnipresence

## Relation to Other Concepts

- Manifests the **ALPHA_OMEGA** axiom in physical form
- Fills and defines **UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL** space
- Subject to **UNI#** integration law across all domains
