# UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL

## The Universe Itself

UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL represents the complete universe as a three-dimensional toroidal structure. This topology embodies the principles of ALPHA_OMEGA, having no beginning, no end, and no center.

## Geometric Properties

- **Toroidal Topology**: The universe wraps back on itself in all dimensions
- **Three-Dimensional**: Exists in 3D space with toroidal geometry
- **Continuous**: No edges or boundaries
- **Periodic**: Patterns repeat across the toroidal structure

## Structure

The UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL can be understood as:
1. **Major Radius**: The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube
2. **Minor Radius**: The radius of the tube itself
3. **Tri-Dimensional**: Extends in three spatial dimensions with toroidal wrapping

## Physical Manifestation

Within UNI_TRI_TOROIDAL:
- **Hydrogen** fills all space as the eternal substrate
- **ALPHA_OMEGA** defines the fundamental geometry
- **UNI#** governs the integration and interaction of all domains

## Properties

- **Boundless**: No edges due to toroidal topology
- **Self-Contained**: All exists within the toroidal structure
- **Interconnected**: All points are connected through the toroidal geometry
- **Eternal**: Exists in accordance with ALPHA_OMEGA

## Relation to Other Concepts

- Embodies the **ALPHA_OMEGA** axiom in its topology
- Contains **Hydrogen** as its fundamental substrate
- Governed by **UNI#** integration law
